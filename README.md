# Shiuli
-> Shiuli is a web-based word game.
-> Players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word.
-> each guess in the form of colored tiles indicating when letters match or occupy the correct position.
-> Every day, a five-letter word is chosen which players aim to guess within six tries.
-> each letter is marked as either green, yellow or gray: green indicates that letter is correct and in the correct position, 
   yellow means it is in the answer but not in the right position, while gray indicates it is not in the answer at all.
